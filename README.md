# Creation of neuronal ensembles and cell-specific homeostatic plasticity through chronic sparse optogenetic stimulation

Ben Liu, Michael Seay, Dean V. Buonomano (2022)

This github repository is designed to reproduce the figures containing the spiking model results.

## Installation

- Start from a Python 3 Anaconda environment (the crucial libraries are `numpy`, `matplotlib`,`scipy`, `seaborn`, and `pandas`).
- Install `brian2` according to the installation instructions (https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction/install.html).
- Install `dill` by running `conda install dill` at an Anaconda-enable command line.
- Clone this repository.

## Usage

- At an Anaconda-enabled command line, make this repository your current directory.
- Run `python fig5a.py`, `python fig5bc.py`, `python fig5de.py`, and `python fig6.py`. Generate figures will appear as PDF files in the root directory.
